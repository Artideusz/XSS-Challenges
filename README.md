# XSS Challenges

There are 3 different challenges that showcase:
- Reflected XSS
- DOM-Based XSS
- Persistant XSS

## What is the challenge goal?
Your job is to invoke XSS on all 3 of these challenges on page load for max points. I recommend researching about this topic on google and/or learn from my notes about XSS [here.](https://github.com/Artideusz/My-cyber-security-notes/tree/master/Web/Code%20Injection/Cross-site%20Scripting)

## Running the server using npm
To run the server using a local node.js server, all you need to do is:
- [git clone](https://gitlab.com/KavenOZ/github-notes) this repository to a folder.
- cd to the directory.
- run the server using npm start or node app.js.

## Running the server using Docker
To run the server using Docker, you need to:
- docker pull from this dockerhub [repository]().
- `docker run -d -p <host port>:8080 <pulled repo>`
